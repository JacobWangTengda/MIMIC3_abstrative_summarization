admission . </s> <s> a temporary pacer was placed . </s> <s> bradycardia was thought to be secondary to over beta-blockade . </s> <s> the patient 's bradycardia continued with an underlying rhythm of atrial fibrillation . </s> <s> the patient had a permanent pacemaker placed on unk , without complications . </s> <s> of note , the patient underwent an atrial fibrillation ablation on unk , with no further complications . </s> <s> the patient was maintained on telemetry while admitted , and upon discharge , she remains av paced and hemodynamically stable . </s> <s> ischemia : </s> <s> the patient experienced several episodes of substernal chest pressure associated with shortness of breath and nausea while admitted . </s> <s> she was evaluated with cycling of cardiac enzymes and electrocardiograms . </s> <s> each episode of chest pressure led to her ruling out for myocardial infarction . </s> <s> pump : </s> <s> the patient has left ventricular ejection fraction of greater than 55 % on several echocardiogram performed while in the ccu . </s> <s> she had interval increased in her pleural effusions while admitted , especially on the left side . </s> <s> the pleural effusion was evaluated by thoracentesis on unk . </s> <s> the pleural fluid analysis demonstrated fluid that was consistent with transudative process with the likely etiology of congestive heart failure . </s> <s> on discharge , the patient 's room air oxygen saturation was 93 % . </s> <s> this was evaluated at rest , and the patient will continue to need supplemental oxygen and further evaluation for her requirement upon optimal diuresis . </s> <s> upon discharge , the patient was only on diuretics , and her medical regimen with be further optimized by her primary cardiologist as an outpatient . </s> <s> 2. infectious disease : the patient was noted to have persistently febrile periods while in the intensive care unit . </s> <s> she was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics and was followed by the infectious disease service . </s> <s> the most likely etiology for her sepsis was a line infection ; however , no source was identified by culturing . </s> <s> upon transfer to the medical floor , the patient remained afebrile , hemodynamically stable , and received her last dose of antibiotics on unk . </s> <s> blood cultures were drawn at that time , and she demonstrated no growth from these cultures prior to the insertion of her permanent pacemaker . </s> <s> 3. heme : the patient was noted to have a normocytic anemia . </s> <s> hematocrit upon discharge was 34.0. the patient was evaluated for evidence of hemolysis several days prior to discharge which was negative . </s> <s> the patient received several units of packed red blood cells to keep her hematocrit above 30. previous work-up of her anemia was consistent with anemia of chronic disease . </s> <s> the patient will need to remain anticoagulated for atrial fibrillation . </s> <s> prior to discharge , she was started on heparin with a goal ptt of 50-70. she was then initiated on coumadin therapy with a goal inr of unk . </s> <s> her inr upon discharge was pending . </s> <s> 4. fen : the patient had a video swallow while admitted to evaluate for aspiration risk . </s> <s> she was noted to have oropharyngeal dysphagia which more compensated for by a chin tuck method with dry swallow . </s> <s> the patient tolerated food and liquids well prior to discharge . </s> <s> 5. neurologic : the patient 's daughter noted that her milk of magnesia was `` tired '' and slow on unk . </s> <s> the feeling was

request : ct of chest w out contrast w airway reconstructio contrast : optiray amt : 100 _ _ _ _ _ clinical information & questions to be answered : request : ct of chest w out contrast w airway reconstruction please evaluate size tracheal stenosis _ _ _ _ _ final report clinical indication : tracheal stenosis . comparison is made to recent study of 2 days earlier . ct airways study was performed according to airway protocol , with initial and inspiratory scan at 2.5 mm collimation with 1.25 mm reconstruction intervals . subsequently , a low-dose scan was performed during dynamic breathing and inspiratory sequence was performed following intravenous administration of contrast . no oral contrast was administered . 2d sagittal and coronal reformatted images were obtained and were interpreted in conjunction with the axial ct images . additional 3d reformatted images were also obtained and reviewed in conjuction with other images . assessment of the airway reveals two sequential areas of tracheal wall thickening which result in mild stenosis . the first is at the level of the tracheostomy site , where anterior wall thickening reduces the ap diameter of the trachea to 19 mm from a dimension of 25 mm above this site . just below this level , there is an area of more significant narrowing , with circumferential wall thickening . at this level , at approximately the thoracic inlet , the coronal dimension narrows to 9 mm . the ap diameter is approximately 21 mm . the normal transverse dimension of the airway above the level of the stenosis is 18 mm . the wall thickening is mostly from the lateral and anterior walls . below the level of the stenosis , the remaining portion of the trachea and the proximal bronchi reveal no significant narrowing . the intrathoracic trachea has a somewhat lunate configuration , with a wide coronal dimension with respect to the ap dimension . this finding can be seen in association with tracheomalacia . however , no excessive collapse is identified within the trachea during expiratory phase of respiration to suggest this diagnosis . on both inspiratory and expiratory views , note is also made of a polypoid type lesion projecting into the airway lumen at the level of the stenosis . this structure measures approximately 3 mm in diameter and appears to be attached to the left lateral wall by a thin stalk . when comparison is made to an earlier study of unk , a similar but smaller polypoid structure was present in this region . this may reflect a granulation polyp . a polypoid area anterior present on an earlier study of unk is no longer visible , and may have become dislodged during interval intubation . assessment of the imaged portions of the lungs ( the lungs were not imaged in their entirety ) is significant for mild emphysema and non specific apical scarring . the overall craniocaudad extent of tracheal narrowing is approximately 3.5 cm .

of an endotracheal tube , there is no significant change in the focal tracheal stenosis which is likely to previous tracheostomy tube complication . the stenosis is characterized by polypoid thickening of the tracheal wall and extends approximately 1.5 cm in craniocaudad dimension . 2 ) no additional areas of stenosis are observed in the remaining portion of the airway . of note , the trachea has a somewhat lunate-shaped configuration , which can be seen in association with tracheomalacia ; dedicated expiratory scans were not performed due to ventilated status of the patient . 3 ) small airways disease in both lower lobes with associated patchy dependent consolidation . these findings suggest aspiration , which may be complicated by infection . 4 ) nasogastric tube side port is

cystic changes , right greater than left , as well as subtle bilateral lenticulostriate vasculopathy . the differential diagnosis was between bilateral grade 1 resolving hemorrhages or cmv infection . examination of the cranium today through the anterior fontanelle and the mastoid foramen again demonstrates complex , now slightly larger and more lace-like cystic regions at both caudothalamic notches . the region on the right measures approximately 2.0 x 0.9 cm and the region on the left now measures approximately 2.0 x 0.9 cm . it is still possible that these findings could be consistent

examination : coiling of r pica aneurysm _ _ _ _ _ final report preop diagnosis : subarachnoid hemorrhage . postop diagnosis : same status post coil embolization of dissecting type right vertebral artery aneurysm . indications : ms . unk is a 47-year-old female who experienced the acute onset of the worst headache of her life approximately two days prior to this admission . she presented to the hospital where a head ct demonstrated the presence of subarachnoid blood within the basal cisterns . a ct angiogram demonstrated the presence of a vertebral artery aneurysm of the right vertebral artery . she undergoes this cerebral angiogram for further evaluation and coil embolization . consent : the patient in the presence of her son and daughter in the prsenced of a unk interpreter were given a full and complete explanation of the procedure . specifically , the indications , risks , benefits , and alternatives to the procedure were explained in detail . in addition , the possible complications , such as the risk of bleeding , infection , stroke , neurological deficit or deterioration , groin hematoma , and other unforeseen complications , including the risk of coma and even death , were outlined . the patient in the presence of her son and daughter in the presence of a unk speaking interpreter understood and wished to proceed with the operation . anesthesia : general endotracheal . procedure in detail : the patient was brought into the endovascular suite and placed on the table in supine position . the right groin area was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion . a 19-gauge single-wall needle was then ( over ) unk 8:08 am carot cereb unk reason : headaches , sah contrast : optiray amt : _ _ _ _ _ final report ( cont ) used to puncture the right common femoral artery , and upon the return of brisk arterial blood , a 5 fr vascular sheath was inserted over a guide wire and kept on a heparinized saline drip . next , a diagnostic catheter was used to selectively catheterize the following vessels : the right subclavian , right vertebral , left subclavian , left vertebral artery and right vertebral artery aneurysm . results : injection of the right subclavian artery shows no evidence of stenosis dissection and a smooth origin of the right vertebral artery . injection of the right vertebral artery shows a normal cervical segment without evidence of stenosis or dissection . intracranially adjacent to the origin of the right pica there is a 5 mm dissecting-type aneurysm of the right vertebral artery . the right vertebral artery is nondominant but flow contribution is seen to the basilar artery and its branches and the posterior cerebral arteries bilaterally . no other intracranial aneurysms are identified . the vertebrobasilar junction is identified and appears to be approximately 1.5 cm distal to this aneurysm . injection of the left subclavian artery shows a smooth origin from the aorta . no evidence of stenosis and a smooth origin of the left vertebral artery . injection of the left vertebral artery shows a normal cervical intracranial course without evidence of stenosis or dissection . because of the wide-necked nature of this dissecting aneurysm we elected for a strategy of vertebral artery occlusion distal to the aneurysm with conversion of the right vertebral artery into a vertebral artery pica artery only . to this end the diagnostic catheter was exchanged for a 5 fr guide catheter over a glide wire . the guide catheter was positioned within the distal cervical segment of the vertebral artery at the level of approximately c2 . through this an xl-14 microcatheter was advanced over a micro guide wire across the aneurysm to a position within the right vertebral artery just proximal to the vertebrobasilar junction . once positioning of this microcatheter was confirmed under biplane roadmap guidance a single vortex gdc 18 fibered coil of 2 x 3 mm dimension was deployed within the right vertebral artery . following deployment of this coil there was flow arrest within the right vertebral artery distal to the aneurysm with preservation of flow through the right pica . after employment of this coil we then withdrew the microcatheter to a position within the aneurysm and deployed a 5 x 8 mm 3d matrix bioactive coil . following deployment of each coil biplane angiographic runs were obtained in the working projections to ensure positioning of the coil and ensure patency of the right pica . second matrix 4 mm soft coil was then deployed within the aneurysm . following deployment of this second coil some re-emergency of flow through the distal right vertebral artery was seen . to occlude this a single hydrocoil 2 x 4 mm was then deployed within the vertebral artery just distal to the aneurysm . deployment of this hydrocoil results again in flow arrest of the flow through the right vertebral artery . at this point a series of soft and ultrasoft matrix coils were then deployed within the aneurysm . following deployment of the last ultrasoft matrix coil which measured 2 x 3 mm in diameter angiographic runs demonstrated a small ( over ) unk 8:08 am carot cereb unk reason : headaches , sah contrast : optiray amt : _ _ _ _ _ final report ( cont ) aneurysmal neck remnant with patency of the pica . because it was felt no further coils could be deployed within the aneurysm without impinging on flow through the pica the procedure was stopped at this point . the entire procedure was performed with intermittent doses of heparin given to maintain an activated clotting time greater than 220 seconds . whole-head images obtained on injection of the left vertebral artery at the end of the procedure demonstrated no evidence of branch occlusion within the basilar artery and its branches of the posterior cerebral arteries bilaterally . injection of the right vertebral artery demonstrated preservation of flow through the right pica . impression : successful coil embolization of a dissecting-type aneurysm of the right vertebral artery using a combination of matrix bioactive and hydrogel coils with conversion of the right vertebral artery into a

coiling of dissecting right vertebral artery aneurysm . postop diagnosis : same with persistent occlusion of right vertebral artery minimal vasospasm . indications : ms . unk is a 47-year-old female who has suffered a subarachnoid hemorrhage from a dissecting-type right vertebral artery aneurysm . she underwent coiling with occlusion of the right vertebral artery and conversion of the right vertebral artery to a vertebral artery pica only vessel . she is now approximately seven days postprocedure and subarachnoid day 10 . she undergoes this examination to assess for a vasospasm in the persistent occlusion of the right vertebral artery . consent : the patient with a spanish translator was given a full and complete explanation of the procedure . specifically , the indications , risks , benefits , and alternatives to the procedure were explained in detail . in addition , the possible complications , such as the risk of bleeding , infection , stroke , neurological deficit or deterioration , groin hematoma , and other unforeseen complications , including the risk of coma and even death , were outlined . the patient with a spanish translator understood and wished to proceed with the operation . anesthesia : conscious sedation . procedure in detail : the patient was brought into the endovascular suite and placed on the table in supine position . the right groin area was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion . a 19-gauge single-wall needle was then used to puncture the right common femoral artery , and upon the return of brisk arterial blood , a 4 fr vascular sheath was inserted over a guide wire and kept on a heparinized saline drip . next , a diagnostic catheter was used to ( over ) unk 12:28 pm carot cereb unk reason : r o recannalization of

vertebral , right common carotid , left common carotid , left subclavian , left vertebral artery . results : injection of the right subclavian artery shows no evidence of stenosis and a smooth origin of the right vertebral artery . injection of the right vertebral artery shows a normal ascending cervical course . intracranially the coil mass is visualized and on injection of the right vertebral artery there is persistent flow through the right pica with no evidence of flow distal to the coiled aneurysm . biplane rotational angiographic images demonstrate some proximity of the coil mass at the origin of pica . however there does not appear to be any evidence of branch occlusion . injection of the right common carotid artery was performed with intracranial imaging . there is minimal vasospasm throughout the distribution of the right mca and aca territories . the external carotid artery also demonstrates normal branching . injection of the left internal carotid artery demonstrates the presence of a bovine-type arch . on injection of the left common carotid artery whole-head views are again obtained . there is minimal vasospasm within the left aca and mca distributions . there is flow across the anterior communicating artery with partially opacified branches of the right aca . no intracranial aneurysms or vasospasm was identified . injection of the left subclavian artery demonstrates no stenosis and a tortuous origin of the left vertebral artery . injection of the left vertebral artery shows a normal cervical and intracranial course . there is good flow to the basilar artery and its branches as well as the posterior cerebral arteries . a small amount of contrast reflux through the very distal-most segment of the right vertebral artery is seen . however this does not go on to opacify the aneurysm . otherwise no intracranial aneurysms or branch occlusion is identified . impression : persistent occlusion of the right vertebral artery at the site of the previously coiled right vertebral artery aneurysm . no evidence of branch occlusion on the right pica . minimal evidence of vasospasm . condition update please see carevue for specifics . neuro : vent

, vascular injury , need for emergency surgery , puncture site bleeding complication , as well as unforseeable complications such as renal toxicity and allergic reaction , together with the potential benefits and alternatives . the patient and his brother gave their full consent to undergo this procedure . procedure description in detail : the patient was taken to the angiography suite and placed on the angiography table in supine position . the right and left groin areas were prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion . 10 cc of 1 % lidocaine without epinephrine was injected into the subcutaneous and subcuticular tissues of the right inguinal region around the right common femoral artery . a small skin incision was made at the puncture site and a 19-gauge single-wall needle was used to point and puncture the right common femoral artery . upon the return of brisk arterial blood , a .035-inch unk guide wire was inserted through the needle and advanced into the abdominal aorta under direct fluoroscopic guidance . the needle was removed and a 6-french vascular sheath by cordis was inserted over the guide wire into the right common femoral artery . the inner dilator and guide wire were removed and the sheath was sutured in place with 0 silk suture . the sheath was connected to a heparinized saline drip and infused throughout the entire procedure . a 5-french berenstein ii angiographic diagnostic catheter was then inserted over the unk guide wire and advanced to the abdominal thoracic aorta under direct fluoroscopic guidance . the catheter was then placed into the right common carotid artery . with the catheter remaining in this position , a hand injection was performed in ap oblique of the cervical carotid artery in the neck , followed by another injection of the right common carotid artery which was performed of the intracranial circulation . at this point , the internal carotid artery was catheterized over a guide wire and with the catheter remaining the right internal carotid artery , a total of eight angiographic runs was obtained with hand injection of approximately 10 cc of non-ionic contrast and a total acquisition of approximately twenty digitally-acquired angiographic images . these projections were performed in ap , lateral , lateral , lateral , lateral , oblique , right anterior oblique , right anterior oblique waters . at this point , the catheter was then selectively catheterized into the left common carotid artery where a single plane angiographic run was obtained of the cervical portion of the common carotid artery . this was then used to selectively catheterize the left internal carotid artery . with the catheter in this position , an ap and a lateral projections were obtained of the left ( over ) unk 12:42 pm carot cereb unk reason : bleed contrast : optiray amt : 320 _ _ _ _ _ final report ( revised ) ( cont ) internal carotid artery with injection of approximately 8 cc of non-ionic contrast and a total acquisition of approximately twenty digitally acquired angiographic images . the catheter was then used to selectively catheterize the left subclavian artery where an angiogram was performed in ap view . this was then used to selectively catheterize the left vertebral artery . with the catheter remaining in the left vertebral artery , an ap view of the left vertebral artery was obtained with the injection of approximately 7 cc non- ionic contrast with a total acquisition of approximately twenty digitally- acquired angiographic images . the catheter was then selectively used to catheterize the right internal carotid artery . at this point , examination of the studies revealed the presence of a bilobed right posterior communicating artery with severe spasm of the middle cerebral artery to the point where it was threadlike , as well as the presence of slow flow in the distal branches of the cerebral artery . the decision was made based on the degree of vasospasm that this aneurysm should be treated in an endovascular fashion . accordingly , the 6-french mpd cordis envoy guide catheter was used to catheterize the right internal carotid artery at the level of the common carotid artery bifurcation . an excel 14 was steam- shaped with a slight angle and an agility 14 soft-tip microwire was used coaxially through the excel microcatheter to catheterize the aneurysm . this was done successfully with the microcatheter within the aneurysm . an angiogram was performed with slow injection through the microcatheter to delineate and confirm the presence of the microcatheter within the aneurysm . this was done with approximately .2 cc of slowly injected contrast and the acquisition of approximately twenty digitally-acquired angiographic images . with the microcatheter inside the right posterior communicating artery aneurysm , a 6-mm gdc-10 2d was deployed within the aneurysm . this allowed us to fill the two lobes of the aneurysm . in addition , after an angiographic run was obtained in two projections , this coil was detached and an additional 6-mm x 10-cm was deployed within the aneurysm , now filling the first lobe and the second lobe of the aneurysm , and this was again detached after obtaining two angiographic runs to confirm the lack of impingement on the parent vessel , and an additional 4-mm x 6-cm gdc-10 2d coil was again deployed and this allowed us to fill the second compartment of the aneurysm to a significant extent . at this point , a decision was made to try one additional coil and this was a 4- mm x 6-cm coil which , during deployment , resulted in herniation of the microcatheter into the parent vessel . as a result , the decision was made to stop the treatment , since the aneurysm appeared that it could not be filled any further . the microcatheter was withdrawn and the previously-placed three coils were still within the aneurysm in stable position . at this point , a total of five angiographic runs was obtained of the right internal carotid artery in various projections , each with injection of 10 cc of non-ionic contrast and total acquisition of approximately twenty digitally-acquired angiographic images per projection . at this point , a decision was made to attempt treatment of the severe vasospasm of the right middle cerebral artery trunk , and this was performed by placing the microcatheter in the internal ( over ) unk 12:42 pm carot cereb unk reason : bleed contrast : optiray amt : 320 _ _ _ _ _ final report ( revised ) ( cont ) carotid artery on the right side beyond the origin of the ophthalmic artery and with the microcatheter in this position , a total of 150 mg of papaverine was pulsed slowly over a period of approximately 15 - 20 minutes with surveillance angiography being performed . this revealed the resolution of the severe vasospasm , improvement in the distal flow and resolution and resumption of visible flow through the right middle cerebral artery m1 segment . at this point , a total of three additional biplane angiographic runs were obtained , one in oblique projection and two of the right internal carotid artery in ap and lateral projections to confirm the absence of any branch occlusions . the catheter and the guide catheter were then withdrawn from the patient . the patient tolerated the procedure well , having suffered no neurological sequelae , and was taken back to the intensive care unit after being allowed to be awakened and noting to follow commands and move all four extremities . he underwent a ct scan of the head which revealed no evidence of acute blood or intracranial hemorrhage , and was taken to the neurosurgical intensive care unit , where he subsequently awoke and was able to follow commands and move all extremities with no neurological deficit and no evidence of pronator drift . findings : 1 ) injection of the right common carotid artery reveals no evidence of atherosclerosis at the bifurcation , but does demonstrate slow flow in the right internal carotid artery . injection of the left common carotid artery reveals no evidence of stenosis or dissection in the bifurcation , and injection of the left subclavian artery reveals no evidence of stenosis or anomaly in the left subclavian artery or any of its branches . injection of the right subclavian artery reveals no evidence of stenosis or dissection or anomaly in the vessel emanating off of the right subclavian artery or the subclavian artery itself . injection of the right internal carotid artery reveals the presence of a 10 x 4 mm posterior communicating artery aneurysm which has a neck of approximately 4 mm , best visualized on the right waters oblique projection view which was also the working projection . injection of the right internal carotid artery reveals the presence of severe vasospasm in the right m1 segment with reconstitution through lenticular striate . the aneurysm was treated successfully using three gdc coils and the vasospasm was relieved significantly with supraselective injection infusion of papaverine . injection of the left internal carotid artery reveals the presence of a dominant anterior cerebral

angiographically demonstrated right sided posterior communicating artery aneurysm . there is more subarachnoid blood dispersed throughout the basal cisterns and cerebral sulci along both cerebral convexity surfaces , and a more conspicuous degree of intraventricular blood . however , there has been no overt progression of hydrocephalus , presumably due to the insertion of a right frontal intraventricular drain . the right middle cerebral artery infarction is less conspicuous at this time , which may reflect evolution of the infarct . no other new areas of infarction are seen at this

chest x-ray prior to discharge showed interval improvement in the effusions with diuresis . </s> <s> for the patient 's hypertension , hydralazine was started instead of an ace inhibitor , given the

patient 's creatinine stabilized an ace inhibitor was started and hydralazine was in the process of being titrated down . </s> <s> 2. pulmonary : given the fact that the patient had these immune pleural effusions of unclear etiology , initially the thought was to try and tap the pleural effusions . </s> <s> the family requested that the interventional pulmonology service perform the tap ,

metabolic illness 2 . weight loss 11 % from birth weight plan -we have started intensive phototherapy and will monitor bilirubin closely until it starts to fall . it is reassuring that bilirubin result on admission was lower than that performed 7 hours earlier , even without phototherapy -cbc will be repeated with reticulocyte count -neonatal type and coombs are pending -state screen will be checked in the morning -the slightly elevated d neonatology attending ( continued ) irect reacting component of the bilirubin is likely secondary to inspissation , but this will be followed to ensure complete resolution and exclusion of any underlying cholestasis -given the significant weight loss , we have given a bolus of normal saline and started maintenance iv fluids until bilirubin begins to

identified . the heart size is normal . the mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits . a well circumscribed opacity is identified partially obscuring the medial aspect of the left hemidiaphragm . this is without change since the previous examinations which were also obtained portably . the lungs appear grossly clear , but a portion of the left lower lobe has been excluded from the study and can not be assessed . impression : 1 ) central venous catheter in satisfactory position with no evidence of pneumothorax . 2 ) well circumscribed opacity partially obscuring left hemidiaphragm medially . this is difficult to assess on this portable single projection , but could potentially be due to a peridiaphragmatic abnormality such as a bochdalek herniation . a neoplastic mass can not entirely be excluded . initial further evaluation with a dedicated pa and lateral chest radiograph would be helpful , as well as procurement of earlier outside studies if possible . unk

the right common femoral artery . indication for procedure : this patient was transferred from an outside hospital with a diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage . he is 54 years old and had a sudden onset of headache . he is accompanied by his wife and this angiogram is being performed in order to determine the source of the hemorrhage and to consider endovascular treatment , if it is a suitable lesion . consent : the patient 's wife was given a full and complete explanation of the procedure including the risk of stroke , hemorrhage , death , vascular injury , need for emergency surgery , complications including abdominal hemorrhage , renal toxicity and allergic reaction , together with the potential benefits and alternatives . the patient 's wife agreed to proceed with the operation . procedure : the patient was taken to the angiography operating suite and placed on the angiography table in the supine position . the right and left groin areas were prepped and draped per usual sterile fashion . the patient 's right groin was infiltrated with 1 % lidocaine without epinephrine in the subcutaneous and subcuticular tissues of the right inguinal region . at this point , a small incision was made at the puncture site and a 19-gauge single- wall needle was used to puncture the right common femoral artery . upon the return of brisk arterial blood , a .035-inch unk guide wire was inserted through the needle and advanced into the abdominal aorta under direct fluoroscopic guidance . the needle was then removed and a 6-french vascular sheath was inserted over the guide wire

required bi-pap mask in order to properly oxygenate and increase her oxygen saturation greater than 90 % . </s> <s> she was placed on a bi-pap nasal mask with pressure support of 8 and a peep of 5 and it was titrated to patient comfort to keep her respiratory rate less than 30. the patient was continued on her albuterol and atrovent nebulizers q. two hours . </s> <s> the patient was started on solu-medrol 80 mg intravenously three times a day . </s> <s> on day two of admission , the patient was switched to p.o . </s> <s> prednisone but that afternoon was noted to have worsening oxygenation on bi-pap . </s> <s> she was then switched to a full face mask with improvement in her oxygenation and her coordination with the ventilator . </s> <s> however , the patient was found to be quite somnolent on day three of admission and blood bases a that time showed a ph of 7.31 , a pco2 of 56 , and a po2 of 63 , which is probably very close to the patient 's baseline . </s> <s> it was therefore decided that she was not hypercarbic but that her mental status changes were due to her increased ativan and morphine use for anxiety and back pain while in the medical intensive care unit . </s> <s> the patient continued to require bi-pap at a pressure support of 8 and a peep of 5 with decreased oxygen saturations throughout the day . </s> <s> the patient , in addition , had increased agitation requiring ativan . </s> <s> on the night prior to discharge , the patient was aggressively suctioned with normal saline which yielded several brown and bloody clots . </s> <s> after aggressive suctioning , the patient improved her saturation markedly with an oxygen saturation of 98 % on three liters nasal cannula . </s> <s> the patient continued to saturate well on three liters nasal cannula overnight and throughout the day and she became much more alert and conversant . </s> <s> by the time of discharge , the patient was saturating in the high 90s on three liters nasal cannula . </s> <s> 2. mental status changes : on admission to the medical intensive care unit , the patient was extremely anxious with a very high respiratory rate which calmed down with 2 mg of ativan . </s> <s> on the second day of admission , the patient was requiring ativan q. two and morphine q. two for back pain , and was found to be quite lethargic , so the ativan and morphine were stopped . </s> <s> the patient began to wake up at 8 p.m. on the third day of admission and by the next morning , her mental status was back to baseline . </s> <s> 3. pneumonia : the patient was admitted with a fever of 101.7 f. , and increased white blood cell count of 18 with 5 % bands and a right lower lobe opacity was noted on the chest x-ray . </s> <s> the patient was therefore started on levofloxacin and continued on that coverage for assumed community acquired pneumonia . </s> <s> on the day of discharge , the patient was on day four of a seven day course . </s> <s> this is addendum to problem number one . </s> <s> the patient was transitioned to oral prednisone 60 mg q. day with an aggressive taper to 15 mg q. day over the course of two weeks and she will need to have continued aggressive pulmonary toilet . </s> <s> 4. renal function : the patient was initially admitted with a high creatinine of 1.7 , up from her baseline of 1.2. it was assumed that the patient had prerenal insufficiency due to hypovolemia with a sodium of 138. the patient was hydrated at 100 cc per hour of normal saline . </s> <s> nephrotoxic drugs were avoided and the patient 's renal function returned to baseline on day two of admission and continued to stay at baseline throughout her admission . </s> <s> 5. cardiac status : the patient was complaining of chest pain on the second day of admission . </s> <s> she complained of chest pain 10 out of 10 radiating to her left arm which improved with sublingual nitroglycerin and morphine times two . </s> <s> the cardiac enzymes were cycled and remained negative . </s> <s> the patient 's chest pain resolved and was assumed to be secondary to her pneumonia . </s> <s> in addition , the patient was found to be hypertensive on the second day of admission , with a blood pressure of 170 80. hypertension seemed to be secondary to her decreased oxygen saturation and increased respiratory rate in addition to some pain that she was having , and her hypertension improved considerably once her ventilation was improved . </s> <s> the patient did not need any hypertensive medications during this admission . </s> <s> 6. renal : the patient was initially admitted with a creatinine of 1.7 which was up from her baseline of 1.2 to 1.3. her prerenal insufficiency was considered to be secondary to hypovolemia and prerenal failure . </s> <s> the patient was hydrated with 100 cc per hour of normal saline and by discharge her creatinine had returned to its baseline of 1.3 . </s> <s> 7. prophylaxis : the patient was maintained on subcutaneous heparin and ranitidine . </s> <s> 8. code status : the patient was `` do not resuscitate '' , `` do not intubate '' . </s> <s> communication was maintained with the husband . </s> <s> several family meetings were arranged to discuss the long term care of the patient . </s> <s> in addition , palliative care was involved with the patient 's care . </s> <s> the patient lives with her husband . </s> <s> 9. pain control : the patient was complaining of considerable back pain during this hospitalization , requesting morphine . </s> <s> on the day of discharge , the patient was transitioned from morphine intravenously p.r.n . </s> <s> to ms-contin for longer acting pain control with msir for breakthrough pain . </s> <sec> sinus tachycardia . possible left atrial abnormality . st junctional

detail to the patient and the family . they understood and signed the consent form . both groins were prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion . using standard seldinger technique , the right common femoral artery was percutaneously punctured and a 4 french sheath placed . following the diagnostic arteriogram the four french sheath was exchanged for an 8 french cook sheath and this was sutured in position . through the 8 french sheath dilator system , 4 french berenstein catheter , in conjunction with a terumo glide wire was used to select the right common carotid artery . this was started in the neck in the ap and lateral positions and in the head in the ap and lateral positions . the left common carotid artery was selectively catheterized and arteriograms were performed in the ap and lateral positions . imaging of the head was also performed in the ap and lateral positions . after review of films the catheter was withdrawn . mac anesthesia was administered for this

middle cerebral artery . at this point according to the patient 's clear wishes , and realizing his increased morbidity , after discussing with dr . unk it was decided to stent the left common carotid artery . the patient was given iv heparin in an attempt to bring her act to 2.5 times normal and glycopyrolat in 0.2 mg bolus form in order to protect him from vagal response . 8 french guiding catheter was placed with the aide of terumo glide wire in the left common carotid artery . this was started in the neck using magnified oblique projections and also 3d projections . a 5 mm x 4 cm angioplasty balloon was placed over an exchange length 14 agility microwire wire into the carotid across the lesion . it is inflated to approximately 6 atmospheres for approximately 10 seconds . following inflation the balloon was deflated and the angiogram performed which demonstrated marked improvement in the caliber . two stents were placed ( 8 mm x 4 cm and 7 mm x 3 cm ) across the already narrowed distal common carotid artery and proximal internal carotid artery . angiogram of the left internal carotid artery demonstrated questionable nonopacified angular branch of the left

transfusion , but eventually did consent . </s> <s> she was given two units of packed red blood cells with bump in the hematocrit to 33. since the transfusion her hematocrit had remained stable in the 31 to 33 range . </s> <s> hemolysis and dic panels were sent , which were not worrisome for hemolysis or dic . </s> <s> iron studies were sent which were not consistent with iron deficiency anemia and she has low iron but elevated ferritin and low tibc . </s> <s> her stools were repeatedly guaiac negative . </s> <s> she had no gastrointestinal symptoms and her bun remained low normal , which all of this is not consistent with gastrointestinal bleed . </s> <s> at this time it is not known why her hematocrit was so low at 21 . </s> <s> if all other work up is negative , the possibility is that she actually had a significant blood loss from her scalp laceration as the patient does report that she bled enough that she did actual mopping of the blood on her bathroom floor . </s> <s> however , it should not be discounted that further work up may be necessary , including outpatient colonoscopy as well as possible need for bone marrow biopsy to completely work up this anemia with low mcv . </s> <s> it is anticipated that if the hematocrit remained stable and the patient did well after her pacemaker placement that she will be discharged to home . </s> <s> if there are any further events there will be an addendum to this summary . </s> <sec> patient test information : indication : left ventricular function . status : inpatient date time : unk at 11:01 test : portable tte(complete ) doppler : complete pulse and color flow contrast : none technical quality : adequate interpretation : findings : left atrium : the left atrium is mildly dilated . right atrium interatrial septum : the right

supported by increased bnp . </s> <s> he was given additional iv lasix . </s> <s> because of concern for aspiration pna , he underwent speech and swallow evaluation which was normal . </s> <s> ce and

raised concern for ards . </s> <s> he was also intermittantly febrile . </s> <s> he was therefore intubated on unk and treated with vancomycin and meropenem for hospital acquired pneumonia , although no organism was ever isolated . </s> <s> his condition did not improve for over 12 days and in the interim he was started on azithromycin and flagyl to cover for anerobes and atypicals . </s> <s> patient had also been trialed on five day course of steroids . </s> <s> he ultimately underwent tracheostomy placement , and over the ensuing days was weaned off the vent and placed on trach mask . </s> <s> unfortunately , he had an aspiration event after coming off the vent and his respiratory status worsened . </s> <s> he was started back on vanco and zosyn for hap aspiration pna and should

comparison : ct abdomen and pelvis of unk . technique : mdct-acquired axial images were obtained through the abdomen and pelvis following the administration of oral and intravenous contrast material . oral contrast material was instilled through the post-pyloric tube . multiplanar reformatted images were generated . ct abdomen with iv contrast : at the lung bases , extensive interstitial and ground-glass opacities involving both lung bases , but largely sparing the anterior portion of the right middle lobe , have improved since the most recent chest ct . additionally , there has been resolution of bilateral pleural effusions . the heart is enlarged , but there is no pericardial effusion . atherosclerotic calcifications are noted of the coronary vessels and the aortic valve . in the abdomen , a peg tube terminates in the stomach , and a post-pyloric feeding tube terminates in the proximal jejunum . the liver , gallbladder , pancreas , spleen , and adrenal glands are unremarkable . the kidneys enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically , with large simple cysts bilaterally , unchanged . there is no hydronephrosis or renal mass . the distal stomach and duodenum are

complications . these include , but are not limited to stroke , infection , death , vessel rupture , vessel injury , as well as other unforseen complications . the patient 's family understood and they wish to proceed with the operation . procedure and detail : the patient was brought into the endovascular suite and placed in on the table in supine position . the right and left groin areas were prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion . at this point a 5 french vascular sheath was inserted through the right common femoral artery and the sheath was kept on a heparinized saline flush . at this point a 5 french berenstein catheter was used to selectively catheterize the following vessels : the left common carotid artery followed by the left internal carotid artery . review of the study revealed severe vasospasm in the distal right middle cerebral artery territory which is concordant with the patient 's weakness on the left side . this was rendered even more serious because of the chronic occlusion of the right internal carotid artery . examination of the right common carotid artery bifurcation revealed stenosis to be at most 50 % and as such was not deemed to be hemodynamically contributing to the patient 's decreased perfusion of the right cerebellar hemispheres . at this point decision was made to proceed with superselective infusion of papavarine into the right a1 segment in order to obtain papaverine effect in both the right middle cerebral artery and more proximally by infusing into the left a1 segment in order to also obtain papaverine effect in both anterior cerebral arteries . to that end a guide catheter was placed into the left common carotid artery and through the guide catheter a microcatheter was used to subsequently catheterize the left internal carotid artery in the intracranial portion , followed by the left anterior cerebral artery a1 segment , followed by crossing of the anterior communicating , followed by placement of the

effect the right cerebral hemisphere . at this point the microcatheter was withdrawn into the left a1 segment and from this position an additional 150 mg were infused of papaverine . following infusion of papaverine into the left a1 and to the right a1 , angiography was performed through the guide catheter of the left internal carotid artery . at this point , after review of the films , it showed satisfactory improvement in the right middle cerebral artery and hemispheric vasospasm and the guide catheter was withdrawn from the patient and the patient was transferred back to the icu in stable condition . results : injection of the left common artery and cervical region reveals no evidence of new stenosis or dissection , and shows approximately 50 % focal stenosis at the bifurcation . injection of the left internal carotid artery revealed persistent obliteration of the aneurysm with the coils that were previously placed into the aneurysm , and evidence of vasospasm involving the distal branches of the middle cerebral artery , as well as the endocervical trunk to a lesser degree on the right side . this was treated using superselective infusion of papaverine by placement of the microcatheter into the intracranial portion of the left a1 segment of the anterior cerebral artery and then into the right a1 segment of the anterior cerebral artery for a total of 150 mg of

shows somewhat more clearly the evolution of a moderate sized right middle cerebral artery infarct which extends towards the vertex and likely involves the contiguous distal right anterior cerebral artery territory . the hemorrhage within this area of infarction is essentially unaltered in extent as are the numerous areas of hemorrhage elsewhere within the brain and ventricular system . the left frontal ventricular drain is again noted . there is no shift of normally midline structures . no alteration of ventricular size is appreciated . conclusion : findings consistent with development of a

, as well as other unforeseen complications . they understood and wished to procede . indication : this patient is a 78-year-old woman who presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage and is undergoing this diagnostic angiogram to determine the source of the hemorrhage and to determine how to best procede with therapy . procedure in detail : patient was brought into the endovascular suite and placed on the table in supine position . the right and left groins were prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion . a 5 fr vascular sheath was inserted into the right common femoral artery . at this point a 5 fr berenstein type ii catheter was used to selectively catheterize the vessels in the following succession : right common carotid artery , left common carotid artery , left internal carotid artery , followed by left subclavian artery , right subclavian artery , and then right subclavian artery with the cuff inflated . a this point , review of the studies revealed the fact that the patient had a chronic occlusion of her right internal carotid artery and her left internal carotid artery is providing full to the entire hemisphere via a anterior communicating artery . the source of the hemorrhage was then identified as a 6 mm left a1-a2 segment aneurysm which was anteriorly pointing . given the patient ' age and her grade , the decision was made to procede with endovascular coil embolization , particularly in light of her right carotid artery occlusion . to that end , patient underwent replacement of the 5 fr berenstein catheter with a 5 fr mpc guidecatheter which was primed with a microcatheter and a microwire . these were used to catheterize the aneurysm with the microcatheter in the aneursym , a series of nine coils were deployed inside the aneurysm with an excellent angiographic result . at this point , the catheter and the wire , as well as the guidecatheter , were all withdrawn from the patient after obtaining a postembolization angiographic run . results : injection of the right common carotid artery reveals no filling of the right internal carotid artery . injection of the right common carotid artery also reveals the presence only of a right external

findings : left atrium : the left atrium is moderately dilated . right atrium interatrial septum : a catheter or pacing wire is seen in the right atrium and or right ventricle . left ventricle : the left ventricular cavity size is normal . overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed . there is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis . aorta : the aortic root is normal in diameter . aortic valve : the aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened deformed . there is severe aortic valve stenosis . mitral valve : the mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened . there is moderate mitral annular calcification . mild ( 1 + ) mitral regurgitation is seen . tricuspid valve : moderate to severe [ 3 + ] tricuspid regurgitation is seen . there is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension . pulmonic valve pulmonary artery : physiologic ( normal ) pulmonic regurgitation is seen . pericardium : there is no pericardial effusion . general comments : a left pleural effusion is present . conclusions : 1 . the left atrium is moderately dilated . 2 . the left ventricular cavity size is normal . overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed . there is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with preservation of basal wall motion . 3 . the aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened deformed . there is probably severe aortic valve stenosis . 4 . the mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened . mild ( 1 + ) mitral regurgitation is seen . 5 . moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation is seen . the tricuspid regurgitation is caused ( at least in part ) by the right atrial pacer wire bouncing on the tricuspid valve . 6 . there is at least mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension . 7 . in comparison to the previous

iatrogenic dissection at an outside institution . postoperative diagnosis : there is no evidence of residual vertebral artery dissection or intimal irregularity and approximately 13 mm aneurysm of the left posterior communicating artery aneurysm treated successfully using endovascular coil embolization without iatrogenic complication . anesthesia : monitored anesthesia care following by general endotracheal anesthesia . indication : ms . unk a left posterior communicating artery aneurysm for which underwent cerebral angiography at an outside institution . during that she was noted to unk an iatrogenic dissection vertebral artery for which was placed on oral anticoagulant . she is now returning to determine whether she needs to continue oral anticoagulation or whether her intimal dissection has healed and also to determine whether the left posterior communicating artery aneurysm can be treated using endovascular means . consent : the patient and her husband were given a full and complete explanation of the procedure . specifically , the indications , risks , and benefits and alternatives to the procedure were explained in detail . in addition , the possible complications such as the risk of bleeding , infection , stroke , neurological deficit or deterioration , groin hematoma , and other unforeseen complications including the risk of coma and even death were outlined . the patient and her husband understood and wished to proceed with the operation . procedure in detail : the patient was brought in the endovascular suite and ( over ) unk 9:55 am carot cereb unk reason : headaches admitting diagnosis : aneurysm sda contrast : optiray amt : 325 _ _ _ _ _ final report ( cont ) placed on the table in supine position . the right groin area was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion . a 19 gauge single wall needle was then used to puncture the right femoral artery and upon the return of brisk arterial blood a 5 fr vascular sheath was inserted over a guidewire and kept on a heparinized saline drip . next a diagnostic catheter was used to selectively catheterize the following vessels over a guidewire in succession : left subclavian artery , left vertebral artery , right subclavian artery , right vertebral artery , left common carotid artery , left internal carotid artery , left internal carotid artery intracranial portion , left posterior communicating artery aneurysm , and then finally left internal carotid artery status post coil embolization . results : injection of both subclavian arteries reveals no evidence of atherosclerotic disease or stenosis at the origin of the vertebral arteries . injection of the left vertebral artery showed it to be the dominant of two . the left vertebral artery cervical course including its origin was free of any intimal irregularity or dissection or atherosclerotic involvement . injection of the right subclavian artery showed no evidence of atherosclerotic disease or stenosis at the origin of the vessel or in its cervical course . injection of the right vertebral artery shows normal course in the cervical segment and injection of both vertebral arteries intracranially showed a normal vertebrobasilar junction , normal basilar artery and normal basilar apex . these are consistent with a healed previous intimal dissection and accordingly , the patient no longer requires oral anticoagulation . our attention was then turned to the left internal carotid artery and then a left common carotid artery injection showed a smooth carotid artery bifurcation with no atherosclerotic disease . injection of the left internal carotid artery with three dimensional rotational angiography showed a dominant contribution from the left posterior communicating artery . note was made of an aneurysm which measured approximately 13 mm and its widest diameter and has a favorable geometry for endovascular therapy . accordingly , a microcatheter was used after replacement of the diagnostic catheter with a guide catheter and through that microcatheter , a microwire was used to navigate into the aneurysm . with the microcatheter inside the left posterior communicating artery aneurysm , a series of gdc coils followed by hydrocoils were deployed into the aneurysm with serial angiography until a totality of 9 coils were placed . these showed excellent packing density with no further filling of the dome or the inflow zone of the aneurysm . there was no evidence of branch occlusion or compromise of the native luminal vessel by the coil placement . at this point , a final three dimensional rotational angiography was performed as well as the biplane angiogram which showed no distal branch occlusion or iatrogenic complication . examination of the left internal carotid artery showed a small 1 mm to 2 mm shallow aneurysm at the proximal portion of the carotid siphon . this will be followed with serial studies . the anterior communicating comple is normal .
