intravenous contrast . delayed-phase images of the chest , abdomen , and pelvis were also performed . ct of the chest with and without iv contrast : the patient is status post recent coronary artery bypass graft surgery and placement of a wire mesh stent into the aortic arch . along the distal portion of the stent laterally , there is some inward buckling of the stent with thrombus beyond the walls of the stent . otherwise the stent is mostly of flush against the wall of the aorta . a mostly thrombosed pseudoaneurysm adjacent to the aortic arch of 3 cm in diameter has an overall similar appearance , except that now the previously noted pooling of contrast medially is absent . the proximal portion of the left subclavian artery is occluded , but beyond the short segment of occlusion , there is retrograde filling . there is a new graft connecting the aorta with the proximal right brachiocephalic artery . post-operative changes are noted in the mediastinum , including pneumomediastinum and soft tissue density . no mediastinal , hilar , or axillary lymphadenopathy is noted . the pulmonary artery and its major branches are patent . there is atelectasis in parts of the left lower lobe and small bilateral effusions . otherwise , the lungs are clear . ct of the abdomen with and without iv contrast : there is atherosclerotic change in the aorta but no abdominal aortic aneurysm . the liver appears normal . there is gallbladder wall thickening , without distention or stones , a nonspecific appearance . this appearance could be due , for example , to fluid overload , but correlation with clinical factors is suggested . the pancreas , spleen , and adrenal glands are within normal limits . there is a new peripheral perfusion defect in the posterior left

 <s> in summary , this is a 65-year-old male with psychotic depression and schizoaffective disorder , who presented with decreased oral intake and aspiration pneumonia . </s> <s> 1. aspiration pneumonia : the patient was treated with 14 days of intravenous levofloxacin and flagyl . </s> <s> the patient had intermittent episodes of desaturations to the 70 % and 80 % . </s> <s> these desaturations were thought to be due to aspirations because they resolved with aggressive suctioning . </s> <s> the patient is currently on 3 liters of nasal cannula , but most likely will be weaned down to room air . </s> <s> 2. nutrition : the patient has been refusing p.o . </s> <s> intake since hospitalization . </s> <s> partial parenteral nutrition was considered ; however , it would not contribute to the patient 's comfort and would only provide at the maximum of 25 % of the patient 's daily needs . </s> <s> since the patient was refusing laboratory draws , it was also thought unwise to start partial parenteral nutrition without being able to monitor the patient for refeeding syndrome . </s> <s> the patient is being maintained with d-5 normal saline with 40 meq of unk at 100 cc per hour . </s> <s> the patient has largely been refusing p.o . </s> <s> intake but has on occasion taken sips of boost . </s> <s> 3. psychotic depression : the patient was evaluated by psychiatry on admission . </s> <s> since he was refusing all medications it was thought that the patient could be a candidate for electroconvulsive therapy treatment . </s> <s> the patient was evaluated by anesthesia who felt that the patient could not undergo electroconvulsive therapy without being intubated . </s> <s> it was thought , however , that if the patient was intubated he may not be able to be weaned off of the ventilator . </s> <s> also , since electroconvulsive therapy treatment requires multiple treatments over several days , it was felt that intubating the patient for this period of time would be unsafe . </s> <s> it was then suggested that the patient zyprexa dissolvable wafer ; however the patient still refused to take the zyprexa . </s> <s> 4. neurology : it was clear that the patient was suffering from a neurodegenerative disease , but at this point it appears that it is end-stage . </s> <s> the patient had refused mri , and although the guardian had given approval for a mri , the mri was not able to be performed because the patient 's son had interfered . </s> <s> it was also felt that the patient would have to be sedated to under mri , and it was felt that considering the patient 's tenuous pulmonary status that he would not be able to be sedated safely . </s> <s> neurology suggested prescribing sinemet . </s> <s> the patient has been refusing sinemet during this hospitalization . </s> <s> they also suggested a voiding antipsychotic such as haldol which may causes exacerbation of the patient 's contracted state . </s> <s> the patient has been refusing further workup of his neurodegenerative disease . </s> <s> during this entire hospitalization , the patient has been refusing the majority of care . </s> <s> the patient is at times verbally abusive . </s> <s> an court decision regarding dnr dni comfort measures was pursued . </s> <s> the end result was that the patient died in the hospital , due to inanition and respiratory failure . </s> <sec> sinus rhythm . occasional unifocal ventricular premature beats . left atrial abnormality . inferior , infero-posterior and inferolateral myocardial infarction of undetermined age . t wave abnormalities probably secondary to the previously noted myocardial infarction . compared to the previous tracing of unk ventricular ectopy is now present . no other diagnostic interim changes . sinus rhythm . significant q waves in leads ii , iii and avf . deep s waves in lead v2 . t wavwe inversions in leads v4-v6 . int : transmural inferior myocardial infarction - old . voltage for left ventricular hypertrophy . non-specific anterolateral t wave abnormalities . unk 4:14 pm ct chest w contrast ;

 <s> 1. endocarditis issues : the patient was treated with vancomycin and gentamicin for part of her admission due to concern over a levaquin allergy . </s> <s> levaquin was restarted on unk with no

; infectious endocarditis per the infectious disease service . </s> <s> either way , the treatment was to be six weeks of antibiotics with vancomycin and levaquin on discharge with doses of 1 gram intravenously once per day and 500 mg by mouth once per day ; respectively . </s> <s> in addition , the patient had an equivocal bartonella antibody result with equivocal bartonella henselae igg ( unk ) . </s> <s> will repeat per infectious disease service instructions . </s> <s> unlikely that the patient has bartonella acutely as she had no risk factors ( per infectious disease consultation ) . </s> <s> 2. rhythm issues : the patient was in atrial fibrillation . </s> <s> diltiazem was initiated in the emergency room , but it was stopped secondary to insufficient rate control . </s> <s> the patient was loaded with amiodarone and controlled once the transesophageal echocardiogram showed no emboli . </s> <s> beta blockade was changed to an ace inhibitor on transfer from the medical

on telemetry at the time of discharge . </s> <s> the patient was continued on coumadin throughout the hospitalization with a brief period of heparinization for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement given paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and the risk of further embolic cerebrovascular accident . </s> <s> 3. pump issues : the patient had a normal ejection fraction of 65 % per transthoracic echocardiogram on unk . </s> <s> however , the patient had severe mitral regurgitation . </s> <s> given this finding , the patient received afterload reduction initially with captopril which was discontinued secondary to ? </s> <s> cause of drug rash and then started on an angiotensin receptor blocker ( valsartan 80 mg by mouth every day ) . </s> <s> the patient 's blood pressure remained well controlled , and her rash disappeared . </s> <s> there was no rash at the time of discharge . </s> <s> the patient was initially diuresed using lasix as needed to keep the lungs as dry as possible . </s> <s> at the time of discharge , the lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally and the patient had not required lasix for over one week ; largely secondary to minimal oral intake . </s> <s> 4. anemia issues : the patient 's hematocrit goal was greater than 30. the patient received two blood transfusions during her admission . </s> <s> of note , the patient has alloantibodies ( fyb jka antibodies ) which require her to receive matched red blood cells . </s> <s> this is important for any future transfusions . </s> <s> emergent transfusions of unmatched o negative blood could

patient has a history of a partial left lobectomy for a benign process . </s> <s> 6. cerebrovascular accident issues : the patient had multiple small infarctions on magnetic resonance imaging . </s> <s> a magnetic resonance imaging magnetic resonance angiography performed on unk showed small acute infarctions both corona radiata , right vasoganglia , and left parietal cortical region , moderate-to-severe changes in small vessel disease in the periventricular region , with chronic lacunar infarctions in the vasoganglia and corona radiata bilaterally . </s> <s> the magnetic resonance angiography was normal except for a nonvisualized distal right vertebral artery which could be secondary to artery ending in the posterior inferior cerebellar artery . </s> <s> a carotid ultrasound revealed right internal carotid artery with 60 % to 90 % stenosis , the right vertebral artery was not visualized , the left internal carotid artery with less than 40 % stenosis , and left antegrade

appeared on unk in the setting of greater than a 1-week use of levaquin and a 3-day use of captopril . </s> <s> secondary to a dermatology consultation , this rash was believed consistent with a drug reaction . </s> <s> the plan was to discontinue the captopril and transiently discontinue levaquin . </s> <s> the levaquin was restarted on unk with no recurrence of this drug rash . </s> <s> 8. nutritional issues : the patient 's oral intake dwindled over the course of this admission . </s> <s> she originally was eating in the medical intensive care unit and by day 18 her poor oral intake continued . </s> <s> the patient was periodically given d-5 half normal saline to maintain her fluid status . </s> <s> given that we believed this poor oral intake to be a transient problem , she was originally planned to have radiology pass a very thin nasojejunal tube not available on the floor prior to disposition to a skilled nursing facility for intravenous antibiotics . </s> <s> due to emergencies in the radiology department , this tube could not be placed for several days . </s> <s> therefore , a nasojejunal tube was inserted on unk . </s> <s> prior to this , the nutrition service

to continue oral intake as tolerated and replete electrolytes as needed . </s> <s> on unk the patient 's family requested that a feeding tube be inserted ( percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube ) given that they believed that the patient would require exogenous feeding for a long period . </s> <s> thus , the nasojejunal tube placement was cancelled , and a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube was ordered ; requiring wait for inr to be less than 1.5 per gastroenterology recommendations . </s> <s> the patient removed her nasojejunal tube on unk and refused reinsertion initially . </s> <s> however , the tube was reinserted the next day after she was prevailed upon to change her mind . </s> <s> the patient removed this tube again . </s> <s> a dobbhoff tube was reinserted over the weekend ( on unk ) . </s> <s> the patient removed this tube the next day ( on unk ) along with her foley catheter and was found out of bed . </s> <s> given her refusal to reinsert , we decided to wait for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube the following day . </s> <s> a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube was inserted on unk and tube feeds resumed through this percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube early in the morning on unk . </s> <s> the patient tolerated the procedure well ; although she was unhappy with the need for a feeding tube and initially refused usage of it . </s> <s> 9. change in mental status and mood issues : the patient had an increasingly flat affect over the course of her admission with dwindling spontaneous speech and movement . </s> <s> the psychiatry team was consulted on unk ( requested on unk ) . </s> <s> psychiatry 's impression was that there was no clear psychiatric illness and that the presentation was likely secondary to medical illness and neurologic sequelae of cerebrovascular accidents . </s> <s> the presentation was termed an apathetic syndrome , not a depressive one , related to several acute infarctions ; most notably the right vasoganglia infarction . </s> <s> given that it is exceedingly difficult to reverse apathy , and that the stimulant ( ritalin had been started several days prior ) as the appropriate choice of unk as we had already performed , a success rate is also quite low . </s> <s> in this case , the patient had a lot of ectopy , and so the risk of continuing ritalin therapy outweighed the potential benefit . </s> <s> the psychiatry service also believed that it was never clear that the patient ever needed zoloft and that this medication would not reverse apathy even if it was increased , the attending stopping zoloft . </s> <s> both zoloft and ritalin were stopped on unk . </s> <s> secondary to prevention of coronary artery disease , the patient was continued on a statin and restarted on aspirin after her percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube was placed . </s> <sec> patient test information : indication : endocarditis . bp ( mm hg ) : 90 45 hr ( bpm ) : 130 status : inpatient date time :
